#summary A walk through the directory structure of dil.

= Project Tree =

As dil has grown quite a bit in its life time, it has become a necessity to document its structure. Interested developers can view this guide and quickly gain a good understanding of the location of various components in the system.

  * *`data/`*<br>Contains dilconf.d (the configuration file of dil,) language files and other files that are required by some subcommands in dil.
  * *`i18n/`*<br>Language catalogue files. Part of src/translator/. Not in use at the moment.
  * *`kandil/`*<br>An XHTML/JS front-end for documentation of D source files.
  * *`scripts/`*<br>Very useful utility scripts are located here.
    * `build.py`: Build dil with this if you don't have or want [http://dsource.org/projects/dsss DSSS].
    * `phobos_doc.py`: Generates documentation for Phobos and optionally creates a zip archive.
    * `tango_doc.py`: Like phobos_doc.py, but for Tango.
    * `typerules.d`: Generates interesting tables of type rules in the compiler that compiles it.
  * *`src/`*<br>The source folder which holds most of the source files.
    * *`cmd/`*<br>Modules that implement the subcommands of the main application.
    * *`dil/`*<br>The root package of the project.
      * *`ast/`*<br>Includes modules for building (full) parse trees (not abstract syntax trees which have less information.)
        * `Node.d`: Contains the abstract base class from which all other parse tree elements derive.
        * `Visitor.d`: Implements an abstract base class for traversing parse trees.
      * *`code/`*<br>Will contain or contains modules related to interpreting code and generating LLVM IR trees (Intermediate Representation.)
      * *`doc/`*<br>Modules that allow for documentation generation are located here.
        * `DDocEmitter.d`: Has a class that traverses a parse tree and emits macros with text to a buffer.
        * `Doc.d`: Consists of classes and functions which find, sanitize and parse Ddoc comments into sections.
        * `Macro.d`: Implements Ddoc macro expansion.
      * *`lexer/`*<br>Everything related to the lexing process is present here.
      * *`parser/`*<br>The place where the huge Parser resides. She's best friends with the Lexer.
      * *`semantic/`*<br>The analytic system that tries to make sense of the code you throw at it. Throws it back if it doesn't.
        * `Passes.d`: The semantic passes that go over a module until all symbols are resolved.
        * `Symbols.d`: Classes, structs, variables, functions, templates etc. are symbols.
        * `Types.d`: All the semantic types are in this file.
      * *`translator/`*
        * `German.d`: A feeble attempt on a class that translates D code into German.
      * `Compilation.d`: The !CompilationContext class encloses important parameters relevant to the compilation process. E.g.: debug/release build, finding modules, sizes of machine dependent types, 32/64Bit code generation etc.
      * `Diagnostics.d`: Just a class that collects error messages to be printed to the console.
      * `ModuleManager.d`: Searches for modules in include dirs, loads them and manages them in tables. Reports errors if modules conflict with packages or other modules.
      * `Version.d`: Know the version of the compiler.
    * *`tests/`*<br>Some test cases for the compiler.
    * *`translator/`*<br>My failed attempt at writing a GUI app with !PyQt4 for managing language catalogues (using the YAML format.)
    * `main.d`: The main application with a command-line interface that drives the functions of dil.
  * *`wiki/`*<br>Contains the wiki pages, like this one you're reading.
  * `AUTHORS`: Lists people contributing to this project. Contains my personal testament; just in case I get struck down by a lightning from Zeus (I keep having naughty thoughts of Aphrodite.)
  * `COPYING`: The main license of this project (GPL3.)
  * `dsss.conf`: A makefile used by DSSS to build dil.
  * `README`: Mostly describes how to build dil.
